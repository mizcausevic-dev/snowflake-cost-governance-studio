# Security Policy

`snowflake-cost-governance-studio` ships both an offline analyzer and a synthetic public dashboard surface. It reads JSON exports from Snowflake usage and optimization snapshots (or synthetic data) and emits structured findings, route JSON, and prerendered HTML. No live Snowflake credential storage, no remote fetch of production account data, and no execution of user-supplied code is included.

## Reporting

- [Open a security advisory](https://github.com/mizcausevic-dev/snowflake-cost-governance-studio/security/advisories/new)

## Scope notes

- The public dashboard is a static proof surface, not a live bridge into a production Snowflake account.
- Keep uploaded or tested data synthetic unless you have explicit approval to process a real export offline.
